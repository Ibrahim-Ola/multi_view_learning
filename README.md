# Machine Learning for Multi-view Data

## Overview

Multi-view learning is a machine learning technique that involves training a model to learn from multiple views of the same data. By leveraging the strengths of different views, machine learning algorithms can learn more robust and accurate data models and make more reliable predictions.  For example, image data can be regarded as a two-view data because color information and textual information can be regarded as two separate
groups of features. Each group is regarded as a *view*. Datasets in this category are called multi-view datasets. In this project, I will demonstrate:

1. Multi-view cluster analysis.
2. Multi-view semi-supervised classification.

## Dataset

We will use the publicly available [Multiple Features](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/72/multiple+features) dataset provided by [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) for both classification and cluster analysis.
